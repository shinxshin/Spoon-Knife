FCFS
Given n course processes with their burst times and arrival times, the task is to find average waiting time and average turn around time using FCFS scheduling algorithm. FIFO simply queues processes in the order they arrive in the ready queue. Here, the process that comes first will be executed first and next process will start only after the previous gets fully executed.

Algo2 (SJF)
Start scheduler selects the process from the waiting queue with the least completion time. Shortest course duration First is more desirable than FIFO algorithm because SJF is more optimal as it reduces average wait time which will increase the throughput. This algorithm will consider with the arrival time unlike FCFS and priority scheduling.

Algo3 (priority shceduling)
Priority scheduling is an unprotected algorithm and one of the most common scheduling algorithms in batch systems. Each process is scheduled for its first arrival. (Arrival steps less than before) If two processes have the same arrival time, compare with the priority. (Top Process First) Also, if two processes have the same priority, compare them with process numbers. (Less than previous process number)

This algorithm consider the importance of course unlike FCFS and SJF.
